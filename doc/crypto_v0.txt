cryptography:

H(x) is 512 bit blake2b digest of x
HS(x) is 256 bit blake2b digest of x
MD(x, k) is 512 bit blake2b hmac of x with secret value k
MDS(x, k) is 256 bit blake2b hmac of x with secret value k
NE(k, x) is sntrup4591761 encrypt data x to public key k
ND(k, x) is sntrup4591761 decrypt data x with private key k
SE(k, n, x) is chacha20 encrypt data x using symettric key k and nounce n
SD(k, n, x) is chacha20 dectypt data x using symettric key k and nounce n
S(k, x) is sign x with ed25519 using seed k
ECKG() is generate ec keypair (p, s) public key p, seed s, both 32 bytes
V(k, x, sig) is verify x data using signature sig using public key k
DH(x, y) is a ecdh key exchange using ed25519 scalarmult between public keys x
  and y
KE(x, y) is a ecdh key exchange using H(x + y + DH(x, y))
PKE(x, y, n) is a path key exchange using MDS(n, KE(x, y))
TKE(x, y, n) is a transport key exchange using MDS(n, KE(x, y))
RAND(n) is n random bytes
